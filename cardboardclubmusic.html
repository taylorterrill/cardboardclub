        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
            Blending the styles of Alternative-Rock and Electronic Dance Music, Cardboard Club hopes to carve out their own space in the indie music scene.
            The group follows in the footsteps of the 2010’s Alteronica movement, popularized by artists like Two Door Cinema Club, Passion Pit, Foster the People, and Phoenix.
            Cardboard Club also incorporates the experimental song writing sensibilities of pop acts like Kero Kero Bonito, Gorillaz, and Jack Stauber; hinting at the modern amateur musician’s amazing
            potential to create innovative and exciting new sounds.

            Based in Salt Lake City, Cardboard Club is comprised of singer/lyricist Cristian Banner, guitarist/producer Taylor Terrill, bassist Ricky Casanova, and guitarist Capp Nicoll.
            Banner and Casanova became friends with Terrill in 2011 when they were in 9th grade. The trio’s first time on stage together was that year’s school talent show,
            where they covered Weezer’s “Say it Ain’t So”. Throughout the Weezer fans’ High School and College years,
            they continued to write and perform music together between matches of Yu-Gi-Oh! and late-night PC gaming sessions.
            Finally, in 2020, close friend Nicoll officially joined the band’s lineup.
